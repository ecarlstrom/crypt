# crypt
"The Crypt" JavaScript game

This is a (long) WIP working on a game introduced in John Larsen's *Get Programming with JavaScript*. This will include some of the base game components introduced in the book with numerous modifications made along the way. This readme will help to serve as a tracker for changes made to the base game.
