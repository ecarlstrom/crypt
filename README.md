"The Crypt" JavaScript game

This is a (long) WIP working on a game introduced in John Larsen's *Get Programming with JavaScript*. I am making the base game but adding
some of my own personal functionality based on ideas I may have. There are some basic changes I made as well, including starting the player
as a class rather than a set of variables. The book started from the very basics but since Lambda already covered a fair amount of material
as of the time of this writing (beginning week 5) I decided to implement what I already knew. A class makes more sense as a general player
blueprint to which working object instances can be added.

The eventual goal is to have a fully working game that I can put onto a page as part of a portfolio.

Worth mentioning also that the readme is also a work in progress as I move through the project. Expect this file to be updated occasionally.
